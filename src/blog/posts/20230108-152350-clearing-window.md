After around 1000 LOC, we have a barebones Vulkan application which:

1. Load Vulkan with [`ash`](https://crates.io/crates/ash) crate.
2. Creates Vulkan instance with `VK_LAYER_KHRONOS_validation` and debug
   utilities.
3. Creates window surface with
   [`ash-window`](https://crates.io/crates/ash-window) and
   [`raw-window-handle`](https://crates.io/crates/raw-window-handle) crates.
4. Creates logical device and queues.
5. Creates command pool and buffers.
6. Creates swapchain.
7. Creates semaphores and fences for host to host and host to device
   synchronization.
8. Clears the screen with a different color every frame.

We also handle tricky situations such as user resizing the window and minimizing
the window.

Notably we are not creating render passes or framebuffers, thanks to
`VK_KHR_dynamic_rendering`. We do have to specify some render pass parameters
when we record command buffers, but reducing the number of API abstractions
simplifies the implementation signifcantly. We used this
[example](https://github.com/SaschaWillems/Vulkan/blob/313ac10de4a765997ddf5202c599e4a0ca32c8ca/examples/dynamicrendering/dynamicrendering.cpp)
by Sascha Willems as a reference.

Everything is written under `main()` with minimal abstractions and with liberal
use of `unsafe`. We will do a [semantic
compression](https://caseymuratori.com/blog_0015) pass later once we have
learned more about how the program should be laid out.

Next we will continue with more Vulkan code to get a triangle on the screen.
