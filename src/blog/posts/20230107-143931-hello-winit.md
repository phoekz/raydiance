Before anything interesting can happen, we are going to need a window to draw
on. We use [`winit`](https://crates.io/crates/winit) crate for windowing and
handling inputs. For convenience, we bound the Escape key to close the window
and center the window in the middle of the primary monitor.

For simple logging we use [`log`](https://crates.io/crates/log) and
[`env_logger`](https://crates.io/crates/env_logger), and for application-level
error handling we use [`anyhow`](https://crates.io/crates/anyhow).

Next we are going to slog through a huge amount of Vulkan boilerplate to begin
drawing something on our blank window.
