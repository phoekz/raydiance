Raydiance now supports texture mapped surfaces. We used multiple shortcuts to
get a basic implementation going:

- Only nearest neighbor filtering is supported.
- No mipmaps.
- No anisotropic filtering.
- Only `R8G8B8A8_UNORM` pixel format is supported.

We will revisit these shortcuts later, once our scenes get more complicated.
